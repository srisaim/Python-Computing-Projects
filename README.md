# Python Computing Projects
Introduction to Computing:

Introduction to Computing (CS 110) is a foundational course in computer science that focuses on the principles and practices of computer programming. It introduces students to the concepts and methodologies required to utilize higher-level programming languages effectively and delves into the program development process. The primary objective of this course is to equip students with the skills necessary to design and implement complex and sizable programs. Due to the extensive nature of the programming exercises, the course is challenging and demands significant commitment and effort.
